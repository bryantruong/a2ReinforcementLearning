COMP560 A2: Reinforcement Learning for 3d Tic Tac Toe with NumPy and python3. You must have NumPy and Python 3.6 or greater to run the program.
Clone Directory and run from the shell in the root project directory by calling `python3 learn4x4x4.py x y z`,
where `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative, increasing integers that represent the number of trials
to run.

Example run command: `python3 learn4x4x4.py 100 500 2000`

The program will then print the current utility values after `x` trials, `y` trials, then `z` trials.
